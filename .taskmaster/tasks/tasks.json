URL normalization function handles hostname case conversion, www prefix removal, fragment stripping, trailing slash cleanup, tracking parameter removal, and query parameter sorting for consistent duplicate detection. Cache key generation uses normalized URLs with automatic FNV-1a hashing for long URLs to stay within KV limits. Added comprehensive test coverage with 23 test cases covering all normalization scenarios, cache key generation, and edge cases. All code passes TypeScript strict mode validation.
