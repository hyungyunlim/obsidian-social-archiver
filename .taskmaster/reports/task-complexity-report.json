		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Obsidian Plugin Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Obsidian plugin initialization into subtasks covering: 1) Node.js project setup with package.json and dependencies installation, 2) Obsidian plugin manifest creation with proper metadata, 3) TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path mappings, 4) Vite bundler setup with Obsidian plugin support, 5) Svelte 5 integration with Runes API preprocessing, 6) Main plugin entry point with Plugin class extension, 7) Source folder structure creation following SRP principles, 8) Development scripts and hot-reload configuration. Each subtask should be independently completable.",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield project requiring complete setup from scratch. No existing code, dependencies, or configuration exists. High complexity due to multiple toolchain integrations (TypeScript 5, Svelte 5 Runes, Vite, Obsidian API) and need for proper project foundation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Tailwind CSS Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide Tailwind CSS setup into: 1) Install Tailwind CSS v3 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer dependencies, 2) Configure tailwind.config.js with preflight disabled and Obsidian CSS variable integration, 3) Setup PostCSS configuration for build pipeline integration, 4) Create mobile-first utility classes and responsive breakpoints, 5) Integrate Tailwind directives into styles.css with proper layering. Focus on Obsidian compatibility and mobile touch targets.",
			"reasoning": "Standard configuration task with moderate complexity. Main challenge is ensuring Obsidian style compatibility by disabling preflight and integrating CSS variables. Lower complexity as it's mostly configuration rather than implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Cloudflare Workers Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive Workers infrastructure: 1) Initialize Wrangler CLI and Workers project structure, 2) Configure wrangler.toml with KV namespaces and environment settings, 3) Setup TypeScript for Workers with proper types, 4) Implement API router with Hono or itty-router, 5) Create KV Store bindings for cache, licenses, and shares, 6) Configure CORS headers for Obsidian origins, 7) Implement rate limiting and request validation, 8) Setup local development with Miniflare, 9) Create error handling and logging infrastructure, 10) Deploy to Cloudflare with domain configuration. Each subtask should produce testable infrastructure.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to complete serverless backend creation from scratch. Requires understanding of Cloudflare Workers ecosystem, KV Store operations, security considerations (CORS, rate limiting), and integration with multiple external services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Core Service Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement SRP-compliant service architecture: 1) Create base service interfaces and dependency injection container, 2) Implement ArchiveService for API orchestration, 3) Build MarkdownConverter with template engine, 4) Create VaultManager for Obsidian file operations, 5) Implement MediaHandler for attachment processing, 6) Build ArchiveOrchestrator to coordinate all services, 7) Add comprehensive error handling with custom error classes. Each service should be independently testable with clear single responsibility.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity as it establishes the entire application architecture. While conceptually straightforward (SRP services), requires careful design for testability, proper TypeScript typing, and coordination between services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Platform Detection and URL Validation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build platform detection system: 1) Create PlatformDetector service with URL pattern regex for each platform, 2) Implement URL canonicalization to remove tracking parameters, 3) Add shortened URL expansion with redirect following, 4) Create platform-specific service interfaces, 5) Implement Zod validation schemas for each platform, 6) Add comprehensive unit tests for URL patterns. Focus on accuracy and edge case handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity focused on pattern matching and validation. Main challenges are handling various URL formats, redirect chains, and ensuring 100% detection accuracy. Implementation is straightforward but requires extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create BrightData Integration Service",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement robust BrightData client: 1) Create base HTTP client with request/response interceptors, 2) Implement circuit breaker pattern with state management, 3) Add exponential backoff with jitter for retries, 4) Create platform-specific scraping methods, 5) Implement request queue with concurrency control, 6) Add response validation with Zod schemas, 7) Create caching layer with KV Store integration, 8) Implement cost tracking and credit management, 9) Add comprehensive error mapping and handling, 10) Create request/response logging infrastructure, 11) Build unit and integration tests for reliability patterns. Each subtask should enhance reliability and resilience.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to multiple reliability patterns (circuit breaker, exponential backoff, queuing), external API integration, cost management, and need for robust error handling. Critical component requiring extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
