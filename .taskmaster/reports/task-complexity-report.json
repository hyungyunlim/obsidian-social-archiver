			"taskId": 37,
			"taskTitle": "Create Worker API endpoint for link preview metadata extraction",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down link preview endpoint creation into: 1) URL validation and SSRF protection implementation, 2) HTML fetching with timeout handling, 3) metadata extraction prioritizing Open Graph > Twitter Cards > meta tags, 4) error handling and response formatting, 5) endpoint routing and integration testing. Consider existing Worker patterns and metadata extraction libraries.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a new Worker endpoint requires URL validation, security measures (SSRF protection), HTML parsing, metadata extraction, and error handling. Based on existing workers/src/handlers/ structure, this involves significant HTTP client work, security considerations, and parsing logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Implement KV caching layer for link preview metadata",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement KV caching with: 1) cache key strategy and TTL configuration (7 days), 2) cache hit/miss logic with graceful fallbacks, 3) monitoring and metrics for cache performance. Follow existing KV patterns from archive.ts and consider cache warming strategies.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity building on existing KV patterns. The project already has KV storage implementations in workers, so this leverages existing patterns. Main complexity is in cache strategy and performance monitoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 39,
			"taskTitle": "Create LinkPreviewExtractor service in Obsidian plugin",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create URL extraction service with: 1) regex pattern implementation for URL detection, 2) filtering logic for images and platform-specific URLs, 3) PostData interface updates for linkPreviews field, 4) integration with existing archiving workflow. Follow existing service patterns from src/services/.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to regex implementation, interface changes to core PostData type, and integration with existing archiving flow. Requires careful regex design and integration testing with existing services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 40,
			"taskTitle": "Update YAML frontmatter structure to include linkPreviews",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update frontmatter generation with: 1) linkPreviews field addition to YAML schema with backward compatibility, 2) serialization/deserialization logic updates. Leverage existing FrontmatterGenerator.ts patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity as it builds on existing frontmatter generation patterns. Main concern is maintaining backward compatibility with existing archived posts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 41,
			"taskTitle": "Create LinkPreviewCard Svelte component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build component with: 1) Svelte 5 Runes implementation with preview metadata props, 2) error handling for failed image loads and responsive design, 3) Tailwind styling following existing design patterns. Reference existing share-web components like PostCard.svelte.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity for new component creation. Project uses Svelte 5 with Runes API as seen in PostCard.svelte. Requires responsive design, error handling, and following established design patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 42,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate link preview fetching in share-web SSR",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement SSR integration with: 1) API call integration in PostCard.svelte for metadata fetching, 2) conditional display logic (no images/videos check), 3) error handling and graceful degradation, 4) concurrent fetching optimization with Promise.all. Build on existing PostCard patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to SSR considerations, conditional rendering logic, concurrent API calls, and error handling. Requires understanding of SvelteKit SSR patterns and integration with existing PostCard component."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 43,
			"taskTitle": "Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement rate limiting with: 1) Cloudflare rate limiting or KV-based solution (100 req/IP/hour), 2) request validation and user-agent requirements, 3) suspicious pattern detection and exponential backoff, 4) monitoring and alerting setup. Follow existing security patterns from archive.ts.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity for security implementation. Requires rate limiting strategy, monitoring, and abuse detection. Can leverage existing patterns from archive handler but needs new security logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 44,
			"taskTitle": "Add loading states and skeleton UI for link previews",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create loading states with: 1) skeleton UI components and progressive enhancement from URL to full metadata, 2) CSS transitions and timeout handling. Follow existing loading patterns from share-web components.",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity as it's primarily UI/UX work building on existing component patterns. Main considerations are smooth transitions and progressive enhancement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 45,
			"taskTitle": "Implement metadata extraction optimization and caching strategies",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Optimize metadata extraction with: 1) enhanced HTML parsing using DOM API in Worker, 2) intelligent caching with content-type specific TTLs, 3) cache warming for popular domains, 4) image URL validation and favicon fallback optimization, 5) batch processing implementation for multiple URLs.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving performance optimization, advanced caching strategies, DOM parsing in Worker environment, and batch processing. Requires deep understanding of web scraping optimization and Worker limitations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 46,
			"taskTitle": "Add monitoring, metrics, and cost tracking dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement monitoring with: 1) metrics collection for success rates, cache hits, response times, 2) alert threshold configuration and triggering, 3) Cloudflare Analytics integration and usage tracking, 4) dashboard development for visualization and cost tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity for comprehensive monitoring system. Requires metrics collection, analytics integration, dashboard development, and cost tracking. Building monitoring infrastructure is always complex but critical for production systems."
