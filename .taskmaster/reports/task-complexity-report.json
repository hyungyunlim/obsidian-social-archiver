		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize SvelteKit Share Web Application",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down SvelteKit project initialization into specific setup steps including project creation, dependency installation, TypeScript configuration, Tailwind CSS setup, and routing structure setup. Each subtask should focus on a single aspect of the initial setup.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity project initialization requiring multiple configuration files, dependency management, and proper TypeScript setup. The codebase already has Svelte 5 experience and Tailwind configured in the main plugin, so patterns exist to follow. However, SvelteKit is a new addition requiring adapter configuration and routing setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Workers API with User Timeline Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split Workers API extension into discrete tasks: create user posts endpoint handler, modify existing share handler for user indexing, implement KV user index operations, add proper error handling and validation, implement CORS configuration, and write comprehensive tests. Focus on maintaining existing API patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to extending existing Workers infrastructure with new endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility. Requires careful KV data modeling for user_posts indexes, proper error handling, and integration with existing share functionality. The codebase shows mature Workers patterns but this adds new concepts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SvelteKit API Client and Type Definitions",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create separate subtasks for API client implementation, shared type definitions setup, environment configuration, and error handling implementation. Ensure TypeScript type safety and proper integration with existing type definitions from the workers.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward API client implementation with existing type definitions to build upon. The project already has well-defined API schemas in workers/src/types/api.ts that can be shared. Main complexity is ensuring type safety and proper error handling patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 31,
			"taskTitle": "Create Reusable Svelte Components",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into individual component creation tasks: PostCard component with platform-specific rendering, Timeline container component, PlatformIcon component with SVG assets, SeeMoreButton interactive component, responsive design implementation, and Svelte 5 Runes migration. Each component should follow the existing plugin design patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring Svelte 5 Runes API implementation and consistent styling with existing plugin components. The codebase has existing Svelte components to reference but requires careful attention to design consistency and responsive behavior. Platform icon implementation needs comprehensive SVG asset management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 32,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Timeline and Individual Post Pages",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into page-specific implementations: timeline page component and data loading, individual post page component and data loading, markdown rendering with marked.js, SEO meta tag implementation, error handling for 404 cases, image handling and lazy loading, and mobile-responsive design testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving multiple SvelteKit concepts including server-side data loading, dynamic routing, SEO optimization, and markdown rendering. Requires integration with the Workers API, proper error states, and performance optimization. The combination of SSR, client-side interactivity, and SEO requirements adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 33,
			"taskTitle": "Update Plugin Share Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into focused integration tasks: modify PostCardRenderer createShare method, implement username extraction logic, update API request payload structure, and ensure backward compatibility with existing shares. Maintain existing share functionality while adding user timeline indexing.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring careful modification of existing plugin functionality. The codebase shows mature plugin architecture but requires careful integration to avoid breaking existing share features. Username extraction and API payload modification need thorough testing for edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Cloudflare Pages Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break deployment into configuration steps: wrangler.toml setup with proper bindings, Cloudflare dashboard build configuration, environment variable setup, domain configuration and routing, and deployment pipeline testing. Ensure integration with existing Workers environment.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving Cloudflare infrastructure configuration and integration with existing Workers setup. Requires understanding of KV namespace bindings, R2 bucket access, and proper security configurations. The project has existing Workers deployment experience but Pages deployment adds new concepts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 35,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into optimization and testing categories: bundle size optimization and lazy loading implementation, Lighthouse performance audit and improvements, comprehensive test suite setup (unit, integration, E2E), accessibility compliance verification, SEO optimization with sitemap generation, error boundary implementation, cross-browser testing, and performance monitoring setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity covering multiple optimization domains and comprehensive testing strategies. Requires expertise in performance optimization, accessibility compliance, testing frameworks (Vitest, Playwright), and monitoring setup. The scope includes both technical optimization and quality assurance across multiple dimensions, making it the most complex task."
